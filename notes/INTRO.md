## What is Boolean Algebra?

Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with **true/false** values and logical operations. Named after mathematician George Boole (1815-1864), it forms the foundation of:

- **Computer Science**: Every digital device uses Boolean logic
- **Logic Circuits**: How computer processors work internally
- **Programming**: Conditional statements, loops, and logic
- **Databases**: Query optimization and data retrieval
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Decision making and reasoning

### The Basic Idea

In Boolean algebra, everything is either:
- **True** (represented as `1`)
- **False** (represented as `0`)

Just like regular algebra has operations like addition and multiplication, Boolean algebra has its own operations:

| **Operation** | **Symbol** | **Meaning** | **Real-World Example** |
|---------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **AND** | `&` | Both must be true | "I'll go out if it's sunny AND I have time" |
| **OR** | `|` | At least one must be true | "I'll be happy if I get cake OR ice cream" |
| **NOT** | `!` | Opposite of the input | "I'll go if it's NOT raining" |

### Why This Matters

Boolean algebra is the "language" that computers use to:
- Make decisions ("If user is logged in AND has permission, show content")
- Process data ("Find all customers who live in California OR Texas")
- Control hardware ("Turn on the motor if sensor A is active AND sensor B is inactive")

---

## Exercise Breakdown

### Exercise 00: Adder

**What it does:** Adds two numbers using only Boolean operations (no `+` operator!)

**Why it's important:** This is how computer processors actually add numbers internally.

**The Secret:** We use two concepts:
1. **XOR** for the sum bits
2. **AND** for the carry bits

**Example:**
```
  5 (101 in binary)
+ 3 (011 in binary)
= 8 (1000 in binary)
```

**Real-world application:** Every calculator, computer, and smartphone uses this exact method.

---

### Exercise 01: Multiplier

**What it does:** Multiplies two numbers using only addition and bit shifting.

**Why it's important:** Shows how complex operations are built from simple ones.

**The Method:** 
- Multiplication is just repeated addition
- We use bit shifts to multiply by powers of 2 efficiently

**Example:**
```
5 × 3 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
But we optimize: 5 × 3 = 5 × (2 + 1) = (5 × 2) + (5 × 1) = 10 + 5 = 15
```

**Real-world application:** Graphics processors, encryption algorithms, scientific computing.

---

### Exercise 02: Gray Code

**What it does:** Converts numbers to a special binary representation where adjacent numbers differ by only one bit.

**Why it's useful:** Prevents errors in mechanical systems and digital communications.

**Example:**
```
Normal Binary:  Gray Code:
0: 000         000
1: 001         001
2: 010         011  ← Only one bit changed from previous
3: 011         010  ← Only one bit changed from previous
```

**Real-world application:** Rotary encoders, error correction, digital communications.

---

### Exercise 03: Boolean Evaluation

**What it does:** Evaluates Boolean expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

**What is RPN?** A way to write expressions without parentheses:
- Normal: `(A AND B) OR C`
- RPN: `A B & C |`

**Why RPN?** It's easier for computers to process and eliminates ambiguity.

**Example:**
```
Expression: "10&"
Meaning: 1 AND 0
Result: 0 (false)
```

**Real-world application:** Calculator algorithms, compiler design, expression parsing.

---

### Exercise 04: Truth Tables

**What it does:** Generates complete truth tables for Boolean expressions.

**What's a truth table?** A table showing the output for every possible input combination.

**Example for `A AND B`:**
```
A | B | A&B
0 | 0 |  0
0 | 1 |  0
1 | 0 |  0
1 | 1 |  1
```

**Why useful:** 
- Verify logic circuits before building them
- Understand complex Boolean expressions
- Debug logical errors in programs

**Real-world application:** Circuit design, software testing, logical verification.

---

### Exercise 05: Negation Normal Form

**What it does:** Converts Boolean expressions so negations (NOT) only appear before variables.

**Before:** `NOT(A AND B)`
**After:** `(NOT A) OR (NOT B)` (using De Morgan's law)

**Why important:** 
- Simplifies logical reasoning
- Prepares expressions for further optimization
- Required by many algorithms

**Real-world application:** Theorem proving, AI reasoning, database query optimization.

---

### Exercise 06: Conjunctive Normal Form

**What it does:** Converts expressions to "AND of ORs" format.

**Structure:** `(A OR B) AND (C OR D) AND (E OR F)`

**Why crucial:** This is the standard format for:
- SAT solvers (next exercise)
- Logic programming languages
- Automated reasoning systems

**Example transformation:**
```
Input:  A AND (B OR (C AND D))
Output: A AND (B OR C) AND (B OR D)
```

**Real-world application:** SAT solving, theorem proving, circuit optimization.

---

### Exercise 07: Boolean Satisfiability

**What it does:** Determines if there's any way to make a Boolean expression true.

**The Question:** "Can we assign true/false values to variables to make this expression true?"

**Why this matters:** SAT is one of the most important problems in computer science:
- **NP-Complete:** It's fundamental to computational complexity theory
- **Practical applications:** Software verification, scheduling, planning

**Example:**
```
Expression: A AND (NOT A)
Answer: UNSATISFIABLE (impossible - A can't be both true and false)

Expression: A OR B
Answer: SATISFIABLE (make either A or B true)
```

**Real-world application:** Software verification, AI planning, circuit design, cryptography.

---

### Exercise 08: Powerset

**What it does:** Generates all possible subsets of a given set.

**Example:**
```
Set: {1, 2}
Powerset: { {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2} }
```

**Connection to Boolean algebra:** Each subset corresponds to a Boolean pattern:
- `00`: {} (neither element included)
- `01`: {2} (only second element)
- `10`: {1} (only first element)  
- `11`: {1,2} (both elements)

**Real-world application:** Combinatorial optimization, database operations, feature selection.

---

### Exercise 09: Set Evaluation

**What it does:** Applies Boolean operations to sets instead of true/false values.

**The Connection:**
- **AND** becomes **Intersection** (elements in both sets)
- **OR** becomes **Union** (elements in either set)
- **NOT** becomes **Complement** (elements not in the set)

**Example:**
```
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {2, 3, 4}
A AND B = {2, 3} (intersection)
A OR B = {1, 2, 3, 4} (union)
```

**Real-world application:** Database queries, search engines, data analysis.

---

### Exercise 10: Space-Filling Curves

**What it does:** Maps 2D coordinates to a single number in the range [0,1].

**The Magic:** Uses bit interleaving to preserve spatial locality - nearby points in 2D remain close as 1D numbers.

**Technique:** Z-order curve (Morton order)
```
Point (3,2) → Binary (011, 010) → Interleaved 010101 → Number 0.32...
```

**Why useful:** 
- Spatial databases
- Computer graphics
- Geographic information systems

**Real-world application:** GPS systems, game engines, scientific simulations.

---

### Exercise 11: Reverse Mapping

**What it does:** The inverse of Exercise 10 - converts the 1D number back to 2D coordinates.

**Requirement:** Perfect round-trip accuracy:
```
(x,y) → map() → n → reverse_map() → (x,y)
```

**Technique:** Bit de-interleaving to recover original coordinates.

**Real-world application:** Spatial indexing, coordinate systems, data compression.

---

## Core Concepts

### Boolean Operators as "Rock Paper Scissors"

A helpful way to think about Boolean operators:

**OR (`|`) - "1 beats 0":**
- If ANY input is true (1), the result is true
- Think: "At least one good thing happened"

**AND (`&`) - "0 beats 1":**
- If ANY input is false (0), the result is false  
- Think: "One bad thing ruins everything"

### Truth Value Patterns

| **A** | **B** | **A AND B** | **A OR B** | **A XOR B** |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

---

## Boolean Laws

### The Essential Laws

**1. De Morgan's Laws** (Most Important!)
- `NOT(A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B)`
- `NOT(A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B)`
- **Memory trick:** "NOT distributes and flips the operator"

**2. Distributive Laws**
- `A AND (B OR C) = (A AND B) OR (A AND C)`
- `A OR (B AND C) = (A OR B) AND (A OR C)`

**3. Identity Laws**
- `A OR 0 = A` (0 is neutral for OR)
- `A AND 1 = A` (1 is neutral for AND)

**4. Annulment Laws**
- `A OR 1 = 1` (1 dominates OR)
- `A AND 0 = 0` (0 dominates AND)

**5. Complement Laws**
- `A OR (NOT A) = 1` (always true)
- `A AND (NOT A) = 0` (always false)
